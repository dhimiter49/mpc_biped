# Stable biped walking with MPC

In this repository we implement and test a popular MPC-based approach for balancing the walking procedure of a biped, see [paper](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00390462/file/Preview.pdf) for more details. This toy implementation/simulation ignores the real simulation of the biped [HRP-2 robot](http://mindtrans.narod.ru/pdfs/HRP-2_robot.pdf) and only focuses on coding the relevant analytical solution to the problem.
